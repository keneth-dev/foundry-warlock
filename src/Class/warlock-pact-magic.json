      "value": "<p>Your patron's power grants you special spells called invocations, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your patron.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a single 1st-rank invocation or cantrip of your choice. After that, at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you can choose a new invocation from the list whose rank cannot exceed the maximum rank of spell you can cast (up to 9th rank).</p>\n<p>When you gain a new invocation (but not a cantrip), increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.</p>\n<h3>Invocation Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your invocations are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of invocation that doesn't cost Focus Points. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day.</p>\n<p>You learn <em>eldritch blast</em>, which allows you to unleash rays of raw magical energy on your enemies.</p>"
