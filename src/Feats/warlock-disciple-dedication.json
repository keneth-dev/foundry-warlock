You can cast the initial domain spell for that domain as a warlock invocation. When you reach 10th level, you gain the ability to invoke the advanced domain spell as a warlock invocation.<br />    <strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the disciple archetype.</p>"
