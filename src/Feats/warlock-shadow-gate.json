Unlike the normal teleportation circle, a shadow gate makes use of the Shadow Plane to transport creatures from one end to the other and has the shadow trait.</p>\n<p>If the result of the ritual is a <strong>Critical Failure</strong>, the circle becomes a <em>failed shadow gate</em> which transports any creature that enters to a random location in the Netherworld and inflicts them with 2d6 points of void damage per rank of the ritual. If the creature is reduced to 0 HP from this damage, they are instantly transformed into @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.XrmHgbKgcHDi4OnK]{Shadows} upon their arrival.</p>"
