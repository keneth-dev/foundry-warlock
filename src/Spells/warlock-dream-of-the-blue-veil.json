If the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in the visions.</p>\n<p>To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the world you wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world's existence, even if you don't know the world's name.</p>\n<p>The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage. If you take any damage, the spell ends for you and all other creatures, with none of you being transported.</p>"
