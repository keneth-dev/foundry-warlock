The eye has the minion trait and a climb Speed of 20 feet. The eye is considered a tiny creature with AC 24 and 25 HP. Its Stealth bonus is +20. If your crawling eye is sharing a space with you, you can Dismiss the spell.Â </p>\n<div class=\"item d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p>You can't cast most invocations or spells through the eye, but any effects that affect your sense of sight function through the eye as though it was still attached.</p>\n<p>If your crawling eye is destroyed, you are dazzled for 2 hours, during which time the eye regrows. (If you normally have only one eye, you are blinded instead). Only one of your eyes can be used for <em>crawling eye</em> at any time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
